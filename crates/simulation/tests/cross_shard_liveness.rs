//! Sustained cross-shard traffic must not cost a shard a round.
//!
//! A proposer resolves the reshape load predicate before it builds, and that
//! walk needs every uncommitted ancestor's substate byte delta. Cross-shard
//! blocks are the ones that reliably leave a replica behind on its local
//! execution, so a replica taking its proposer turn mid-catch-up finds the
//! walk unresolvable. It must park and resume when the walk's inputs land —
//! not sit out the view-change timeout, which burns a round on a fallback and
//! costs the shard ~15x its median block spacing.
