//! A replica that restarts rejoins the committee it left.
//!
//! The committed chain survives a restart and everything execution held
//! does not: which tick holds which transaction, and what each tick's
//! baseline was. Both are functions of committed content, and a replica
//! that fails to rebuild them composes a tick its peers do not — which
//! is a fail-stop, not a dropped vote.
//!
//! Sim-only. The restart primitive tears a vnode down and seats it again
//! on the storage it kept, which production would have to do by bouncing
//! a process.
