/// Every term is this shard's. `writes_root` commits to the writes this
/// shard attests — for a batch with cross-shard members the delta is
/// projected to the executing shard before the root is taken, and the
/// fee burn lands only on the payer's side — `event_root` to the events
/// its own emitters produced, and `success` to whether what it ran
/// committed. So the participants in one transaction produce per-shard
/// hashes; agreement across shards is outcome-level in the
/// certificates, never hash equality. A shard running only its own legs
/// of a transaction could attest nothing wider.
///
/// This hash is what validators sign over in execution votes.
/// Ephemeral — never written to storage, only lives for EC aggregation.
