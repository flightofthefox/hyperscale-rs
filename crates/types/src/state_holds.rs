//! Reservations that legs no tick has resolved still hold.
//!
//! A cross-shard leg's reservation is engaged the moment its block
//! commits and released only when its tick's fate does, and in between it
//! is invisible: the settled state a later tick reads still shows the
//! whole balance, because nothing a tick has not resolved may be read.
//! Judging a second withdrawal against that balance is what lets one
//! vault fund two.
//!
//! The amount is the declared one. A reservation says statically how much
//! feasibility is judged against — that is the whole reason the mode
//! carries a number — so the hold needs nothing from the leg's execution
//! and is known from the moment it is dispatched.
